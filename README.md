**April 13th - 14th, 2023** <br>
We are pleased to announce the UCLA synthetic data workshop. This two-day workshop is hosted by the [UCLA Department of Statistics](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) and co-sponsored by [IDRE](https://idre.ucla.edu/), [Science Hub for Humanity and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.sciencehub.ucla.edu/), [ASA Section on Statistical Computing](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/home), [NISS](https://www.niss.org/) and [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/). The workshop is held at the [UCLA Faculty Club](https://facultyclub.ucla.edu/), Morrison Room from April 13-14, 2023.

### About
Synthetic data generation is an interdisciplinary field that is rapidly gaining momentum in both academia and industry. Synthetic data has become a valuable resource for the development of algorithmic procedures, fraud detection, spam identification, and the construction of AI-driven models in industries such as manufacturing and supply chain management. The benefits of synthetic data include cost savings, increased speed and agility, advanced intelligence, and state-of-the-art privacy. The Gartner report forecasts that synthetic data will largely replace real data for training machine/deep learning models by 2030, as depicted in the figure below. Additionally, synthetic data was named one of the top 10 game-changing innovations for 2022 by the [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1045416/10-breakthrough-technologies-2022/#synthetic-data-for-ai). Synthetic data comes in various forms, such as image, text, graph, and tabular data, and has different names, such as simulated data, missing value imputation, and GAN, depending on the scientific community. Synthetic data generation is expected to become an essential component of next-generation machine learning workflows.

Despite the numerous successful applications of synthetic data, its scientific foundation, such as the tradeoff among fidelity, utility, and privacy, is still underdeveloped. Moreover, industrial standards for generating and utilizing synthetic data are not yet fully developed. Additionally, the privacy law on synthetic data is still in its infancy. Therefore, the purpose of this workshop is to bring together a community of synthetic data researchers from statistics, machine learning, and mathematics, policymakers, and industrial partners to collaborate on developing the theory, methodology, and algorithms necessary for producing synthetic benchmark datasets and algorithms.

<!--
Synthetic data generation is a rapidly growing and highly interdisciplinary area that
draws much attention from both academia and industry. For the development of algorithmic
procedures for fraud detection and spam identification, as well as for the construction of AI-driven
models in industries like manufacturing and supply chain management, synthetic data
has become a valuable resource. The advantages of synthetic data include cost savings, increased
speed, agility, increased intelligence, and cutting-edge privacy. According to the Gartner report,
synthetic data will overshadow real data in training machine/deep learning models by 2030; see
Figure below. Additionally, the [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1045416/10-breakthrough-technologies-2022/#synthetic-data-for-ai) named synthetic data as one of its top 10 game-changing innovations for 2022. Synthetic data is everywhere: image, text, graph and tabular data; it has different names: simulated data (for physical scientists); missing value imputation (for statisticians), and more recently, GAN (for computer scientists) etc. Therefore, it is believed that synthetic data generation will be an indispensable part of the next-generation machine learning workflow.

Despite numerous successful applications of synthetic data, its scientific foundation, e.g., the
tradeoff among fidelity, utility, and privacy, is still missing. Additionally, industrial standards
for generating and utilizing synthetic data are not fully developed. Furthermore, the privacy law on synthetic data is still in its infancy. 
Therefore, this workshop is to form a community of synthetic data researchers (from statistics, machine learning and mathematics), policymakers, and industrial partners, and bring them together to collaborate on the development of the theory, methodology, and algorithms needed to produce synthetic benchmark datasets and algorithms.

### Poster
It is strongly encouraged to upload your poster in the registration link below (deadline is April 1st). You need to bring posters to the conference site to setup. The poster exhibit time is from 9:40-3:00 either Thursday or Friday.
<!-- The poster will be asked to upload in the above registration. The deadline is April 1st. -->

### Travel Support
Travel support is available for junior participants (who received PhD degree after 2018), invited speakers and panel discussants. Registration fee will be reimbursed for participants that receive travel support. 

### Registration (Deadline **April 1st, 2023**).

**PLEASE NOTE: Submitting the above Google form DOES NOT guarantee a place in the workshop until the registration fee is paid.**

<!-- 
### Diversity Travel Awards

We are offering travel awards for attendees who will further the goal of increasing the diversity of the synthetic data  workforce. This includes persons from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, and persons with disabilities). You may also apply if you are faculty from an advanced degree granting institution with a high enrollment of underrepresented minority students, who would be interested in partnering with UCLA faculty to make symposium and workshop material available to their students. 

Travel awards will cover travel within the U.S., meals, and lodging.

[Click here](TBD) to apply for a Travel Award for the February 3, 2023 Lange Symposium. 

The travel award application deadline is **TBD**. Results will be announced December 16 2022.
